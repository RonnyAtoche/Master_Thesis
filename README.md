# Master Thesis: Identifying Galaxy Mergers in HST and JWST Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Author: Ronny Atoche

Hereby, I share some of the code I have developed in order to treat the images and train, test, and validate the CNN model. I can not upload all the code and data because there are many big files that exceed the limit allowed by Github per file.
